## 🔧 Data Generation Strategy: Synthea Integration

### Why Synthea?
Synthea (Synthetic Patient Population Simulator) provides realistic synthetic healthcare data that mirrors real-world Electronic Health Records (EHR) without privacy concerns.

### Data Generation Process

#### Step 1: Synthea Installation & Setup
```bash
# Download Synthea JAR file
curl -L -o synthea-with-dependencies.jar https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/releases/latest/download/synthea-with-dependencies.jar

# Generate patient data
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -p 2000 --exporter.csv.export=true Michigan
```

#### Step 2: Data Conversion Pipeline
**Input Files from Synthea:**
- `patients.csv` - Demographics (age, gender, race, state)
- `conditions.csv` - Medical conditions and diagnoses
- `medications.csv` - Prescription records
- `encounters.csv` - Healthcare visits and encounters
- `providers.csv` - Healthcare provider information

**Conversion Process (`convert_synthea_data.py`):**
1. **Data Merging**: Combine patient demographics with conditions, medications, and encounters
2. **Column Mapping**: Transform Synthea schema to Patient360 format
3. **Missing Value Introduction**: Add realistic missing data patterns (15-30% configurable)
4. **Data Quality Issues**: Introduce duplicates, format inconsistencies, and outliers
5. **Output Generation**: Create Patient360-compatible CSV file

#### Step 3: Realistic Data Quality Issues
**Missing Value Patterns:**
- Core fields (Patient_ID, Age): 0% missing
- Administrative fields (Insurance, Region): 2-10% missing
- Clinical fields (Diagnosis_Stage, Comorbidities): 15-25% missing
- Operational fields (Last_Visit_Date, Refill_Number): 20-30% missing

**Data Quality Challenges:**
- Duplicate Patient IDs (~0.5%)
- Inconsistent date formats (5% of date fields)
- Age outliers (impossible values)
- Mixed data types

4. **Visualization Adaptations**: Charts adapt to missing data

### Error Handling Implementation
```python
try:
    # Analytics operation
    result = perform_analysis(data)
    display_results(result)
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Analysis failed: {e}")
    st.info("Please check your data quality or contact support")
```

### Data Validation
- **File Format Validation**: CSV/Excel format checking
- **Column Presence**: Required column validation
